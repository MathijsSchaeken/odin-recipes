        <h3>A delicious and quick meal for 2 persons</h3>

        <p>About as easy and quick as noodles get, Mathijs would say "Godverdomme das makkelijk!"</p>
        <p>Vegetables can be replaced with pretty much any other vegetables suitable for stir-frying</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>200g of salmon (on skin)</li>

            <li>Put in the soba noodles for as long as instructed by the package</li>

            <li>Heat stir-frying pan and a frying pan and add some oil</li>
            <li>Stir-fry vegetables for however long you prefer</li>
            <li>Put the salmon in the frying pan, fry until 2/3 done, then turn salmon upside-down and take the pan off the stove. Let it sit until fully done.</li>
            <li>Roast sesame seeds in hot pan until they're nicely brown and done</li>
            <li>Add cups of sauce together and stir until they're fully mixed</li>
